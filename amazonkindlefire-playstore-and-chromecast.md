# How can I get Google Play Store on my Kindle Fire?
It is actually very easy to get the Google Pl/ay store onto your Kindle Fire. Just follow the these high-level steps:
- Enable `Apps from Unknown Sources`
- Download and install the following APKs in order
  - `Google Account Manager`
  - `Google Services Framework`
  - `Google Play Sevices`

After getting everything installed things may act wonky for a bit while everything is updating. Give it some time. I promise it is easy.
